Today I had to convert an Application Password to Base64 format. However, it's not secure to convert a value to Base64 using online tools. I don't want a 3rd party to know the secret key. Fortunately, Powershell allows a quick method to convert a username and password to Base64.

First create a username and password pair.

```c#
$user = 'user'
$pass = 'password'
$pair = "$($user):$($pass)"
```

```ruby
$user = 'user'
$pass = 'password'
$pair = "$($user):$($pass)"
```

```ruby
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
```
After that we can convert the $pair variable to a Base64 String usign the System.Convert Method. [Microsoft Documentation here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.convert.tobase64string?view=net-5.0)

```c#
# Encode API Credentials
$encodedCreds = [System.Convert]::ToBase64String([System.Text.Encoding]::ASCII.GetBytes($pair))
$basicAuthValue = "Basic $encodedCreds"

Write-Host $basicAuthValue
```

```Python
# Encode API Credentials
$encodedCreds = [System.Convert]::ToBase64String([System.Text.Encoding]::ASCII.GetBytes($pair))
$basicAuthValue = "Basic $encodedCreds"

Write-Host $basicAuthValue
```
